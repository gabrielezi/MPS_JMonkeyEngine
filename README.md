# MPS_JMonkeyEngine
MPS project using JMonkey game engine

This project requires JMonkeyEngine to be downloaded.

Setup the engine:
1) Go to https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/releases
2) Download jME3.3.2-stable.zip
3) Extract the zip to C:\Program Files directory

After these steps you can run the MPS project.

The user can set the terrain size of the game map and then add walls to create e.g. a labyrinth.
